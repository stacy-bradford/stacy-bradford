## Hello world.  I'm Stacy. ðŸ‘‹
<html>
<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
I'm a life long learner who's curious by nature.  As someone who values collaboration and 
  transparency - it should come as no shock that I'm super passionate about open source 
  and the still to be realized potential of web3.  Additionally you shoud know I'm going 
  to do something as different as me with my Github profile - instead of pinning all of the 
  projects I've created while upskilling SQL and Python - I'm going to live my values and 
  elevate devs and their OS tools that are integral to my process.  Plus some other stuff.  ðŸ‘½
