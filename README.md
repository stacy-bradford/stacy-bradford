## Hello world.  I'm Stacy. ðŸ‘‹

<p style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
I'm a life long learner whose curious by nature.  I'm super passionate about open source and the still to be realized potential of web3
as both of which share my core values of collaboration and transparency.  But I'm going to do something as different as me - instead of 
pinning all of the projects I've created while upskilling code - I'm to live my values and elevate devs and their OS tools that are 
integral to my process.
